# OmniGen - AI Video Generation Platform PRD

**Competition**: $5,000 Bounty - AI Video Generation Pipeline  
**Deadline**: Nov 24, 2025 10:59 PM CT  
**MVP Checkpoint**: 48 hours (Nov 17, 2025)  
**Status**: Active Development

## Project Overview

OmniGen is a professional AI-powered video generation platform competing in the AI Video Generation Pipeline bounty. Built as an end-to-end Ad Creative Pipeline that transforms text prompts into professional video advertisements with audio-visual sync, character consistency, and iterative refinement capabilities.

## Core Value Proposition

Generate professional video ads at scale with AI-powered automation:
- Multi-scene composition (3-4 scenes with transitions)
- Character consistency across all scenes (reference image + LoRA)
- Audio-visual sync (background music + sound effects)
- Iterative refinement via chat interface
- Cost efficient at under $2 per minute of video content
- Multi-format generation (16:9, 9:16, 1:1 simultaneously)

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Go)
- REST API built with Gin framework
- AWS SDK v2 for DynamoDB, S3, Step Functions, Secrets Manager
- ECS Fargate deployment with auto-scaling
- Step Functions workflow for video generation pipeline
- Lambda functions for scene generation and video composition
- DynamoDB for job tracking, S3 for video storage

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- Modern React SPA with Vite
- Aurora-inspired dark theme (greens, purples, teals)
- Pages: Landing, Login, Signup, Dashboard, Create, Videos, Settings
- AWS Cognito for authentication
- Real-time generation progress tracking

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
- Modular Terraform configuration
- Single AZ deployment for cost optimization
- ECS Fargate, ALB, Step Functions, Lambda
- CloudFront CDN for frontend
- Cost target: $110-200/month base infrastructure

## Key Features

1. **Video Generation Pipeline**
   - 3-stage workflow: Brief → Generate → Export
   - Multi-format output (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)
   - Brand preset support
   - Real-time status tracking

2. **User Management**
   - AWS Cognito authentication
   - API key-based access
   - Usage quotas and rate limiting
   - Cost tracking per user

3. **Dashboard & Analytics**
   - Video library management
   - Generation metrics (success rate, avg time, cost)
   - Recent activity feed
   - Quick actions (download, edit, duplicate)

4. **Ad Creative Focus**
   - Product showcase videos (15-60s)
   - Social media ad formats
   - Text overlay support
   - Brand styling automation

## Success Metrics

- 30-second video generation in under 5 minutes
- Cost under $2.00 per minute of generated video
- Handle 50+ concurrent video generation requests
- 90%+ successful generation rate
- 98.4% success rate target

## Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Go 1.25.4
- Gin web framework
- AWS SDK v2
- Zap logging
- Swagger/OpenAPI

**Frontend:**
- React 18+
- Vite
- React Router
- AWS Amplify/Cognito

**Infrastructure:**
- Terraform 1.13.5+
- AWS: ECS, Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB, S3, ALB, CloudFront
- Docker for containerization

## Current Status

The project has:
- Complete infrastructure setup with Terraform
- Go backend API with handlers for auth, generation, jobs, health
- React frontend with all major pages implemented
- Aurora-themed UI design system
- AWS integration for storage, compute, and orchestration

## Development Priorities

1. Complete video generation pipeline integration
2. Enhance error handling and retry logic
3. Implement brand preset management
4. Add batch generation capabilities
5. Improve cost tracking and analytics
6. Mobile responsiveness optimization
7. Performance monitoring and alerting

## Design Principles

- **Clarity Over Complexity**: Clear CTAs, obvious next steps
- **Performance Feedback**: Show generation progress, cost estimates
- **Professional Polish**: Production-quality UI, smooth animations
- **Aurora Identity**: Vibrant but not overwhelming color system
- **Cost Transparency**: Clear metrics and performance indicators
